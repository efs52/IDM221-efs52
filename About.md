# Hello!

My name is Elleah Stillman. I am majoring in graphic design with a minor in interactive digital media at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Being a designer has always been at the forefront of my life. It is a creative problem-solving method that applies to any issue or industry. Design has the power to change lives and transform communities. I am eager to continue developing my voice as a creative leader.

I bring positive energy to every team I participate in, as collaboration fuels my creativity. In the classroom and workplace, I am honing my ability to present my ideas and articulate my process and vision. This portfolio demonstrates a commitment to research, iterative methods, and visual storytelling.

When I am not in the studio, you can find me journaling, styling a new outfit, or exploring the city.
