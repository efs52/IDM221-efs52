# The Wagner Free Institute of Science Rebrand

Established in 1855, The Wagner Free Institute of Science is a landmark building featuring historical museum collections that display minerals, crystals, fossils, insects, taxidermy, mounted skeletons, and more. They provide accessible educational programs, archives, museum tours, and community events for people of all ages.

This revolutionary rebrand of the Wagner Institute of Science was focused on honoring the institutionâ€™s history while focusing on how it applies to future generations.
